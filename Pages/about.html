		<h1>This it the about page for my project for Info Visualization on gun violence statistics in America. I decided to explore this topic because I remember consuming a lot of gun violence news/media in 2016. However, I didn't really know too much about the facts/background of gun violence in America besides word of mouth. First, I was interested in how statistics have shifted since the 1999 Columbine shootings. Then I became more interested in the statistics of the perpetrator's background. I realized that March 2020 has been the first month in almost a decade without a school shooting in the USA, which is deeply shocking</h1>
